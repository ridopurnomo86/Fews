          We know it's tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it's important to establish what
          you can expect from us as you use Fews service, and what we expect from you.
        </p>
        <p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-4">
          These Terms of Service reflect the way Fews business works, the laws that apply to our
          company, and certain things we've always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of
          Service help define Fews's relationship with you as you interact with our services. For
          example, these terms include the following topic headings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-disc ml-4 font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-2">
            What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services.
          </li>
          <li class="list-disc ml-4 font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-2">
            What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services.
          </li>
          <li class="list-disc ml-4 font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-2">
            Content in Fews services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the
            content you find in our services-whether that content belongs to you, Fews, or others
          </li>
          <li class="list-disc ml-4 font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-2">
            In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and
            what to expect in case someone violates these terms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-4">
          Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these
          terms.
        </p>
        <p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-900 mb-4">
          Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it's not part of these
          terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage,
          export, and delete your information.
